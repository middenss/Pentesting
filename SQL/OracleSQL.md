#### On Oracle databases, every SELECT statement must specify a table to select FROM. If your UNION SELECT attack does not query from a table, you will still need to include the FROM keyword followed by a valid table name. There is a built-in table on Oracle called dual which you can use for this purpose. For example: UNION SELECT 'abc' FROM dual
